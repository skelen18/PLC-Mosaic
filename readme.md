# PLC Mosaic Solutions

This repository contains solutions for PLC programming assignments I completed as part of my studies. These assignments are based on Tecomat PLC devices and are programmed using the **Mosaic programming environment**. The solutions are designed to help students learn how to work with PLCs and understand basic control logic.

## About the Repository

This repository holds various solutions for PLC programming tasks. Each folder contains a specific project that addresses a unique assignment. The tasks are primarily written in **Czech** as they were created for a school located in the Czech Republic. These assignments are intended for students who are studying automation and PLC programming.

The programs are written in **Mosaic**'s specific assembly language and should be used in the corresponding **Mosaic** software to compile and upload to the Tecomat PLC devices.

## Usage

To use and edit the programs in this repository:

1. **Download the code**: Download the relevant `.asm` file(s) from this repository.
2. **Copy the code into Mosaic**: Do not directly upload the `.asm` file to Mosaic software. Instead, copy the text from the `.asm` file and paste it into a new program in the **Mosaic** software environment.
3. **Set up your PLC project**: Create a new project in Mosaic and add the copied code to the project.
4. **Editing and working in Visual Studio Code**:
   - For a better coding experience with syntax highlighting and ease of editing, you can use the **ASM Code Lens** extension for Visual Studio Code. Install it by searching for `maziac.asm-code-lens` in the VS Code extension marketplace.
   - This will allow you to view the assembly code with proper syntax highlighting and make your editing experience more intuitive.

### Example Folder

For example, the **`traffic_light`** folder contains a solution for controlling a traffic light system. Inside that folder, you will find the **.asm** files for the specific control methods.

### Requirements

- **PLC Tecomat TC 600** or similar device
- **Mosaic Programming Environment** (downloadable from the official Tecomat website)

## How to Use the Solutions

You are free to use the solutions for educational purposes, and you can modify them to fit your own PLC projects. However, these solutions are **not free to copy** and claim as your own. You can modify the code as needed, but please do not present it as your own work. This is intended for students studying automation and PLC programming.

## Language

- The majority of the programs are written in **Czech** because they were created for a school project in the Czech Republic.
- **English** is not used in the programs as this is tailored to local education, but the general structure and logic of the programs are the same, so students outside of the Czech Republic can still benefit from them.

## License

The solutions in this repository are free to use, but not for redistribution or claiming as your own. You can freely edit, adapt, and use these solutions in your own projects, but please respect the original work and give appropriate credit.

## Conclusion

This repository serves as a personal archive of PLC programming solutions for school assignments, and it's available for other students and developers who might benefit from the examples and learning experiences shared here. Feel free to explore the different folders, modify the code, and learn from it to enhance your PLC programming skills!
